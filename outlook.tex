\section{Summary \& Outlook}

X-ray data have shown new, surprising results for the dynamics of material close to pre-main sequence stars, i.e., for accretion and outflow processes. In both cases, high-velocity shocks are among the leading theories explaining the observed X-ray emission. Also in both cases, the comparison with tracers for lower temperature plasma at other wavelengths poses challenges: 

One particular feature that may greatly help in deciphering the underlying physics are the X-ray line profiles, which remain unresolved with current instruments. Therefore, resolving the lines with TBD or TBD is expected to provide the much needed observational constraints for models.

Future instrumentation will also
