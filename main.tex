{\bf Key-points to have in mind}:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The {\it Handbook of X-ray and Gamma-ray Astrophysics} is aiming to publish a work of tertiary literature, which provides easily accessible, digested and established knowledge derived from primary or secondary sources in the particular field. Therefore, your contribution should be clear and concise and be a comprehensive and up-to-date overview of your topic.
\item Length of text: every chapter normally consists of about 10,000-20,000 words (excluding figures and references), which would be about 20-40 typeset pages. However, this is not a rigid rule and it is something to discuss with the Section Editors of the Section of the chapter.
\item Colored figures are welcome in any standard format (jpg, tif, ppt, gif). If possible please provide the original figure in high resolution (300 dpi minimum). {\color{red}\bf Please do not forget to obtain permission in case the figure is from a published article}. For journals like ApJ, PRD, PRL, etc. you do not need the permission if you are an author of the article of the original figures, but for most journals you need the permission even if you are the author of those figures. However, if you create a new figures with minor changes, you can claim it is a new figure and you do not need any permission.
\end{enumerate}
