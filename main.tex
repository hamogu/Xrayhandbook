\section{Introduction}
(3 pages) [Christian]

Star formation sketch [Christian adapted from McCaughrean]
\subsection{Relevant History of T Tauri Stars}
Sketch of T Tauri system [Christian]
\subsection{Properties of T Tauri star systems}
(disk, accretion, outflows)
\subsection{Brief context of other relevant observations}
(Ha for accretion, images/IFU for jets)

Examplary Xshooter spectrum [HMG: I sugest to just ask Carlo for a figure] Venuti et al. 2019?

        IFU image(s) from Takami monitoring

\section{Accretion}
(10 pages)
\subsection{Physics of accretion}
(free-fall, accretion shock, plasma temperature, X-ray emission, etc.) [Moritz, Sabina]

Accretion sketch Hartmann et al. 2016?

\subsection{Observations of Accretion signatures}
Moritz, Christian

Kastner & Brickhouse spectra, other spectra?, Argiroffi redshift? yes, Brickhouse 2012 variability, probably also want some Ha variability, even if we write an X-ray review. Large choice, maybe Alencar?

\subsection{Models}
(historic evolution of models and aspects addressed by models) [Moritz, (Sabina)]

Accretion column models Lamzin 2004, Robinson & Espaillat?; C IV lines (Lamzin 2003?); accretion rates

a figure from any Romanovy work


Radiative transfer (Colombo et al. )

Laboratory experiments (e.g. Burdonov et al. 2020)



\subsection{Connection to other observations}
           Moritz

 Observations of the magnetospheric accretion region (e.g Bouvier et al.)


\section{Jets}
         (10 pages)
\subsection{Physics of jets}
(jet origin, collimation, jet velocities) [Christian, Sabina]

Sketch (suggestion?) should we make a new sketch?

Wind, outflows and jets: Bally 2016 (main components of outflows); Matt & Pudritz 2005 (accretion powered winds), Zanni & Ferreira 2013 (magnetospheric ejections)


\subsection{X-ray jet observations}
Christian

Favata HH 154, Guedel DG Tau, Schneider HH 154

Laboratory experiments  e.g. Revet et al. 2017

\subsection{Models of X-ray emission from jets}
Sabina

3D view based on Ustamujic et al. MHD model

Stationary X-ray emission, HH objects

Collimation by the rotating magnetic field or wind pressure

Bonito et al? (HMG: Not a big fan of the setup wit ha ``nozzle'' at the disk which then leads to the diamond shock, but they are often cited and instructuve picture)â€¨

Lab work in here, too?

\subsection{Connection to other obs}
Christian

UV obs (DG Tau jet), [Fe II] monitoring, Liu [Ne III]?

Jet rotation

\section{Outlook}
(2 pages) [all]

Athena, Lynx, Arcus (figures will be new, Moritz can make for Lynx, Arcus)(?)



\section{Instruction - DELETE}

\vspace{0.3cm}

{\bf Key-points to have in mind}:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The {\it Handbook of X-ray and Gamma-ray Astrophysics} is aiming to publish a work of tertiary literature, which provides easily accessible, digested and established knowledge derived from primary or secondary sources in the particular field. Therefore, your contribution should be clear and concise and be a comprehensive and up-to-date overview of your topic.
\item Length of text: every chapter normally consists of about 10,000-20,000 words (excluding figures and references), which would be about 20-40 typeset pages. However, this is not a rigid rule and it is something to discuss with the Section Editors of the Section of the chapter.
\item Colored figures are welcome in any standard format (jpg, tif, ppt, gif). If possible please provide the original figure in high resolution (300 dpi minimum). {\color{red}\bf Please do not forget to obtain permission in case the figure is from a published article}. For journals like ApJ, PRD, PRL, etc. you do not need the permission if you are an author of the article of the original figures, but for most journals you need the permission even if you are the author of those figures. However, if you create a new figures with minor changes, you can claim it is a new figure and you do not need any permission.
\end{enumerate}

{\bf Submission}:

\vspace{0.1cm}

{\color{red} \bf Please submit source files, compiled pdf file of the chapter, and figure permissions through the Meteor system.}

\vspace{0.5cm}

{\bf arXiv policy}:

\vspace{0.1cm}

{Authors can post their chapter on arXiv if they wish to do it. In the comment field, please write something like ``Invited chapter for {\it Handbook of X-ray and Gamma-ray Astrophysics} (Eds. C. Bambi and A. Santangelo, Springer Singapore, expected in 2022)''. After the publication of the chapter, you may add the DOI on the arXiv page.}
